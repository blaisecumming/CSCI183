I am missing 4)  Split the training data into 2 CV folds, fit a linear regression to the labels using the variables you found
in c on one fold and compute the root mean square error on the other. I just was not able to figure
out how to do this two way comparison. A lot of online documentation talked about the use of a 
linear regression as a means of bounding MSE (on Wikipedia) but I could not find R examples.

All additional includes from Matlab can be found the MatLab includes folder from the root directory of my github page.
